-- Demo Controls --

The demo that comes with the kit is meant as a simple example of
how putting together just a few elements of the kit can generate
some great looking content.  The game supports keyboard controls 
as well as gamepads like the ones available for the XBox and 
XBox360.

 W/A/S/D         Run North, West, South, and East.
 Space           Jump
 Apostrophe      Strafe Modifier
 Enter           Shoot

 Left Thumbstick Run North, West, South, and East.
 Button 1        Jump
 Triggers        Strafe Modifier
 Button 2        Shoot 

You can always use the options dialog to remap controls as needed.

You'll also find these console commands handy...

 god		Makes you invincible.
 ghost		Lets you walk thru walls.
 respawn	Kills you and respawns you.
 loadLevel	Loads the named level file.

You can read more about the utility console commands in the 
online documentation on TDN.
